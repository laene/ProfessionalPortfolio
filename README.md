## About Me

I graduated from the coding bootcamp at University of Texas in January, 2019. I can't believe how much I've learned in just three short months! I feel I've only just started learning Java Script and principles of software development. I'm looking forward to finding a company with a strong mentorship program. In the meantime, this is my portfolio. :)

## About My Code

I kept my portfolio page simple for now using HTML/CSS and JS. I also used jQuery for my Easter Egg game. The photo is from Unsplash.com.

I hope to purchase a domain from Google within the next week.
